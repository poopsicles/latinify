# latinify

Just another super-typical Pig Latin translator...you already know what to expect ðŸ˜‚<br><br>

## Description

A pretty simple bare-bones [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin) translator...that's literally it.

Pig Latin is a fun little "language" of sorts, where the meaning of words are obsufcated through bleeding-edge encryption techniques, rendering the sentence intelligible to the untrained eye.

But you wouldn't dare do that by hand, would you?
